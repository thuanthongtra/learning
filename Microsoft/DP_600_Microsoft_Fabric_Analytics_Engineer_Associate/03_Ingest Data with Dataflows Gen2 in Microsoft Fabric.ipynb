    "## How to use Dataflows Gen2\n",
    "The goal of Dataflows Gen2 is to provide an easy, reusable way to perform ETL tasks using **Power Query Online**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataflows allow you to promote reusable ETL logic that prevents the need to create more connections to your data source. Dataflows offer a wide variety of transformations, and can be run manually, on a refresh schedule, or as part of a Data Pipeline orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataflows can be **horizontally partitioned** as well.\n",
    "  - Once you create a global dataflow, data analysts can use dataflows to create specialized semantic models for specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ways 1 - `Data Pipeline`:** you copy data, then use your preferred coding language to **`extract`**, **`transform`**, and **`load`** the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ways 2 - `Dataflow Gen2`:** Alternatively, you can create a **Dataflow Gen2** first to **`extract`** and **`transform`** the data. \n",
    "- You can also **`load`** the data into a Lakehouse, and other destinations. Adding a data destination to your dataflow is optional, and the dataflow preserves all transformation steps. \n",
    "- To perform other tasks or load data to a different destination after transformation, create a **Data Pipeline** and add the **Dataflow Gen2** activity to your orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Way 3 - `Data Pipeline`** + **`Dataflow Gen2`**: for ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process. \n",
    "- For this order, you'd use a **Data Pipeline** to **`extract`** and **`load`** the data into your preferred destination, such as the Lakehouse. \n",
    "- Then you'd create a **Dataflow Gen2** to connect to Lakehouse data to cleanse and **`transform`** data. In this case, you'd offer the Dataflow as a curated semantic model for data analysts to develop reports."

    "## Benefits and limitations\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Extend data with consistent data, such as a standard date dimension table.\n",
    "- Allow self-service users access to a subset of data warehouse separately.\n",
    "- Optimize performance with dataflows, which enable extracting data once for reuse, reducing data refresh time for slower sources.\n",
    "- Simplify data source complexity by only exposing dataflows to larger analyst groups.\n",
    "- Ensure consistency and quality of data by enabling users to clean and transform data before loading it to a destination.\n",
    "- Simplify data integration by providing a low-code interface that ingests data from various sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "- Not a replacement for a data warehouse.\n",
    "- Row-level security isn't supported.\n",
    "- Fabric capacity workspace is required."
