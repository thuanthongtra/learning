    "# Apply good modeling practices\n",
    "It’s critical that your model enforces data permissions correctly and efficiently. The following list provides you with good development practices to apply.\n",
    "- Strive to define fewer datasets (data models) with well-designed roles.\n",
    "- Strive to create fewer roles by using dynamic rules. A data-driven solution is easier to maintain because you don’t need to add new roles.\n",
    "- When possible, create rules that filter dimension tables instead of fact tables. It will help to deliver faster query performance.\n",
    "- Validate that the model design, including its relationships and relationship properties, are correctly set up.\n",
    "- Use the `USERPRINCIPALNAME` function instead of `USERNAME` function. It provides consistency when validating the roles in Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service.\n",
    "- Rigorously validate RLS and OLS by testing all roles.\n",
    "- Ensure that the Power BI Desktop data source connection uses the same credentials that will be applied when set up in the Power BI service."
