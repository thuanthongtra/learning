    "# Describe medallion architecture\n",
    "Data lakehouses in Fabric are built on the Delta Lake format, which natively supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions. Within this framework, the **medallion architecture** is a recommended data design pattern used to organize data in a lakehouse logically. \n",
    "- It aims to **improve data quality** as it moves through different layers. \n",
    "- The architecture typically has **three layers** – bronze (raw), silver (validated), and gold (enriched), each representing higher data quality levels. \n",
    "- Some people also call it a \"multi-hop\" architecture, meaning that data can move between layers as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture ensures that data is reliable and consistent as it goes through various **checks** and **changes**. It also guarantees that the data is safely stored in a way that makes it **easier** and **faster** to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "The medallion architecture **`complements`** other data organization methods, rather than replacing them.\n",
    "- You can think of the medallion architecture as the framework for data cleaning, rather than a data architecture or model. \n",
    "- It ensures compatibility and flexibility for businesses to adopt its benefits alongside existing data models, allowing you to customize data solutions and preserve expertise while remaining adaptable in the ever-changing data landscape.\n",

    "# Considerations for managing your lakehouse\n",

    "\n",
    "Secure your lakehouse\n",
    "Secure your lakehouse by ensuring that only authorized users can access data. In Fabric, you can do this by setting permissions at the workspace or item level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workspace permissions control access to all items within a workspace. Item level permissions control access to specific items within a workspace, and could be used when you're collaborating with colleagues who aren't in the same workspace, or they only need access to a single, specific item.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can strategically store different layers of your lakehouse in separate workspaces for improved security and efficient capacity management. This approach not only enhances security but also optimizes cost-effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security and Access Considerations: Define who needs access at each layer, ensuring only authorized personnel can interact with sensitive data.\n",
    "Gold Layer Access Control: Restrict access to the Gold layer for read-only purposes, emphasizing the importance of minimal permissions.\n",
    "Silver Layer Utilization: Decide whether users will be allowed to build upon the Silver layer, balancing flexibility and security.\n",
    "Bronze Layer Access Control: Restrict access to the Bronze layer for read-only purposes, emphasizing the importance of minimal permissions.\n",
    "Sharing of Fabric content should be discussed with your organization's security team to ensure that it aligns with your organization's security policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)\n",
    "Designing a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process for a lakehouse architecture involves several considerations to ensure a smooth and efficient deployment process. Considerations include implementing data quality checks, version control, automated deployments, monitoring, and security measures. Considerations should also include scalability, disaster recovery, collaboration, compliance, and continuous improvement to ensure reliable and efficient data pipeline deployments. While some of these are related to processes and practices, others are related to the tools and technologies used to implement CI/CD. Fabric natively provides several tools and technologies to support CI/CD processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git integration in Microsoft Fabric enables you to integrate development processes, tools, and best practices straight into the Fabric platform. Fabric's Git integration enables data teams to back up and version work, revert to previous stages as needed, collaborate with others or work alone using Git branches, and leverage the capabilities of familiar source control tools to manage Fabric items.\n",
    "\n",
    " Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more about Git integration in Fabric in Introduction to git integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "CI/CD is crucial at the gold layer of a lakehouse because it ensures that high-quality, validated, and reliable data is available for consumption. Automated processes enable continuous integration of new data, data transformations, and updates, reducing manual errors and providing consistent and up-to-date insights to downstream users and applications. This enhances data accuracy, accelerates decision-making, and supports data-driven initiatives effectively."
