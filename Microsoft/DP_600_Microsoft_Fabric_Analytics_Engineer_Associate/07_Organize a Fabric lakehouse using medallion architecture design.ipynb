    "# Describe medallion architecture\n",
    "Data lakehouses in Fabric are built on the Delta Lake format, which natively supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions. Within this framework, the **medallion architecture** is a recommended data design pattern used to organize data in a lakehouse logically. \n",
    "- It aims to **improve data quality** as it moves through different layers. \n",
    "- The architecture typically has **three layers** â€“ bronze (raw), silver (validated), and gold (enriched), each representing higher data quality levels. \n",
    "- Some people also call it a \"multi-hop\" architecture, meaning that data can move between layers as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture ensures that data is reliable and consistent as it goes through various **checks** and **changes**. It also guarantees that the data is safely stored in a way that makes it **easier** and **faster** to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "The medallion architecture **`complements`** other data organization methods, rather than replacing them.\n",
    "- You can think of the medallion architecture as the framework for data cleaning, rather than a data architecture or model. \n",
    "- It ensures compatibility and flexibility for businesses to adopt its benefits alongside existing data models, allowing you to customize data solutions and preserve expertise while remaining adaptable in the ever-changing data landscape.\n",

    "      - **Dataflows:** are a great option for **`smaller` semantic models** and **`simple` transformations**. \n",
    "      - **Notebooks:** are a better option for **`larger` semantic models** and **`more complex` transformations**. Notebooks also allow you to save your transformed data as a managed Delta table in the lakehouse, ready for reporting.\n",
    "  - **Data orchestration:** refers to the coordination and management of multiple data-related processes, ensuring they work together to achieve a desired outcome\n",
    "    - The primary tool for data orchestration in Fabric is **`pipelines`**. \n",
    "      - A pipeline is a **`series of steps`** that move data from one place to another, in this case, from one layer of the medallion architecture to the next. Pipelines can be automated to run on a schedule or triggered by an event."
