    "## Use Cases for Data Activator\n",
    "Data Activator can help you in various scenarios, such as dynamic inventory management, real-time customer engagement, and effective resource allocation in cloud environments. It's a potent tool for any circumstance that requires real-time data analysis and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Data Activator to:\n",
    "- Initiate marketing actions when product sales drop.\n",
    "- Send notifications when temperature changes could affect perishable goods.\n",
    "- Flag real-time issues affecting the user experience on apps and websites.\n",
    "- Trigger alerts when a shipment hasn't been updated within an expected time frame.\n",
    "- Send alerts when a customer's account balance crosses a certain threshold.\n",
    "- Respond to anomalies or failures in data processing workflows immediately.\n",
    "- Run ads when same-store sales decline.\n",
    "- Alert store managers to move food from failing grocery store freezers before it spoils."

    "## Understand Data Activator key concepts\n",
    "Data Activator operates based on four core concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Events** - Data Activator considers all data sources as a sequence of events, each representing an observation about the status of a particular object. These events can occur frequently, as with IoT sensors, or less frequently, such as when monitoring package scanning in shipping locations.\n",
    "2. **Objects** - Data Activator’s objects can be tangible items like vehicles or packages, or abstract concepts like advertising campaigns or user sessions. When creating a Reflex item, you model the object by connecting one or more event streams. You then select a column for the object ID, and specifying the fields to become properties of the object.\n",
    "3. **Triggers** - Data Activator’s triggers are designed to monitor your events and data, initiating specified actions once certain conditions within these events are fulfilled.\n",
    "4. **Properties** - Data Activator’s properties are beneficial for reusing logic across various triggers. You could, for instance, set up a property on a smart lighting system to track the average brightness levels during the busiest hours of the day. This average could then be used in numerous triggers to correctly tweak the lighting and save energy."

    "### Define a trigger condition and action in Data Activator\n",
    "Data Activator’s triggers define the conditions and actions to perform based on what’s happening in the data. Let's consider the following example, you work at pharmaceutical company and would like to monitor the temperature of multiple packages you need to ship. You need an alert to be sent to the shipping department when the temperature exceeds 48 degrees. You start by creating a new trigger.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then you select your data by either choosing a column from an event, or from a property you’ve already defined. In our example, you would pick the temperature column like the next screenshot demonstrates.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you pick your column or property, Data Activator returns a preview of the values for a sample of the instances of the object. For example, in this screenshot, Data Activator returns the temperature of different packages in the last 24 hours.\n",

    "\n",
    "It’s now time to define the conditions you want to detect. You can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a **_numeric_** condition like when the battery level falls below 20%.\n",
    "- Choose a **_logical_** condition like when a device average temperature goes above 150 degrees.\n",
    "- Choose a **_common_** true/false condition like when a production line sensor has been triggered.\n",

    "\n",
    "In our example, you choose a numeric condition, and set the value to greater than 48 degrees. Once the condition has been set, two charts are returned based on your historic data. The first chart displays a few samples when the condition was detected. And the second chart returns the total number of triggers that would have been fired. For your packages with temperature greater than 48-degrees example, the following charts would be returned.\n",

    "Depending on the action you choose, you're prompted to provide additional information. For example, if you choose to send an email, you're asked to provide the email address of the recipient, the subject, and the body of the email. In our example, you're asked to provide the recipients, headline, optional message and any additional information you want to send.\n",
